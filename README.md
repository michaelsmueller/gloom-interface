# Gloom Interface

_Transactions outside the light of day._

## Overview

Gloom lets you conduct a private auction of ERC-20 tokens. The process is as follows:

1. **Setup**: seller configures the type and amount of tokens, makes an ETH deposit into the auction contract, invites bidders (Ethereum addresses) and sets a bidder ETH deposit requirement.
2. **Commit**: bidders deposit into the auction contract and present their bids (in ETH) for the tokens. Bids are hidden (salted and hashed) and recorded on the blockchain.
3. **Reveal**: bidders reveal their bids (only if they match the earlier commits), with the winner determined and an escrow contract deployed.
4. **Deliver**: seller and winning bidder deliver tokens and payment, respectively, to the escrow contract.
5. **Withdraw**: seller and winning bidder withdraw proceeds and tokens, respectively, from the escrow contract. Everyone withdraws their deposits from the auction contract.

## Requirements

You will need the following to install and interact with Gloom Interface (my version noted):

- Node (recommended v14.15.1)
- Yarn (recommended v1.22.10)
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) wallet (browser extension)

## Installation

Clone this repository and the Gloom Core repository into the same parent directory.

If you are running on a local blockchain instance (Gloom CLI) you will need to first follow the instructions in the Gloom Core repository before launching the interface.

### Gloom Interface installation

In the Gloom Interface directory, install package dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

To launch on localhost, run:

```
yarn start
```

## Get testnet tokens

To use Gloom, first you need to get some tokens to auction, either MIKE tokens (local blockchain) or testnet tokens (Kovan blockchain):

### MIKE tokens on localhost (Ganache)

If you are running Ganache CLI blockchain locally, the migration in Gloom Core will mint 1 million **MIKE** ERC-20 tokens into the deployer address (first Ganache address, `accounts[0]`). Gloom Interface will read the contract address of this locally deployed token, and you may test auction them. To see them in your MetaMask wallet you will need to add them manually there:

1. Copy the MikeToken contract address that appears in the console after executing `truffle migrate --reset`
2. In MetaMask select Add Token (at bottom of Assets), Cutom Token, and paste the contract address, add the symbol MIKE and specify 18 decimals.
3. You should now see the 1 million MIKE token balance in your account. You will need to repeat the same procedure for other accounts (e.g. if you auction the tokens to another address) to see them there as well.

### Testnet tokens (Kovan)

The contracts have been deployed to the **Kovan** testnet (see `deployed_addresses.txt`). The contract ABIs in the `src/contracts` directory should allow you to interact on Kovan.

For KETH (Kovan testnet ETH), please check:

- [Kovan testnet faucet](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet#) - request testnet ETH for Kovan
- [MyCrypto faucet](https://app.mycrypto.com/faucet) - get testnet ETH for various networks

For Kovan testnet ERC-20 tokens, please check:

- [Uniswap Interface](https://app.uniswap.org/) - swap KETH into Kovan DAI, MKR, UNI or WETH
- [Chainlink faucet](https://kovan.chain.link/) - get 100 Kovan LINK
- [AAVE v2 faucet](https://testnet.aave.com/faucet) - mint various tokens here

To see your testnet ERC-20 tokens in MetaMask, you will need to add them as Custom Tokens using the Kovan token contract addresses:

- UNI `0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984`
- LINK `0xa36085F69e2889c224210F603D836748e7dC0088`
- SNX `0x7fdb81b0b8a010dd4ffc57c3fecbf145ba8bd947`
- YFI `0xb7c325266ec274feb1354021d27fa3e3379d840d`
